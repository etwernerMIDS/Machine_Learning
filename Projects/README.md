* [Final Project](https://github.com/etwernerMIDS/Machine_Learning/tree/master/Projects/Final%20Project/w207_final_project-master)

The main focus of the Final Project is to improve the Amazon Fine Foods marketplace experience by helping both consumers and retailers glean better insights on the items they buy or sell. It is a group project in which we intend to leverage machine learning algorithms in order to provide services that would benefit both ends of the marketplace. My main personal contribution was the recommender system.

*All of these projects were completed for UCB's Master of Data Science Course W207 - Applied Machine Learning. These were completed using Python Jupyter Notebooks.*
